Custom Post Avatar gives you the possibility to replace your default avatar by a custom image on each post individually.

== Description ==

Custom Post Avatar is inspired by Aaron Parecki's Emoji Avatars functionality on his website (https://aaronparecki.com/2019/02/25/9/emoji), but instead of beeing related to the used emojis in the content it is possible to choose it from the media library independend.

Major features in Custom Post Avatar:

* Optionally select custom avatar for each post.
* Replace avatar only for the post author, not for comment authors.

To get results out of this plugin you'll need a theme displaying user avatars via the get_avatar function.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your WordPress Site/Blog, activate it and use it in your posts.

== Roadmap ==

In the first version you're able to select the custom post avatar from all images in the media library. The next step is to give each user an editable list of individual avatars which will be shown in the edit post sidebar as a radio button list.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.1 =
*Release Date - 15 March 2019*

* Initial version with basic functionality.
